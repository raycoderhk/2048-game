## 🎯 Major Accomplishments

### 1. CLI Tools Development (Karpathy-Inspired) ✅

**Inspired by Andrej Karpathy's vision: "Build for Agents"**

#### Polymarket CLI
- **Location:** `/home/node/.openclaw/workspace/clis/polymarket/`
- **Files:** `polymarket.py`, `polymarket.sh`, `README.md`
- **Features:**
  - Top markets by volume
  - Search functionality
  - Dashboard view
  - Watchlist tracking
- **Status:** ✅ Complete (using Mock Data)
- **⚠️ Important:** Uses simulated data, NOT real Polymarket API
- **Next:** Integrate real API (Metaculus or Polymarket)

#### OpenClaw Status CLI
- **Location:** `/home/node/.openclaw/workspace/clis/oc-status/`
- **Files:** `oc-status.py`, `oc-status.sh`
- **Features:**
  - Gateway status monitoring
  - Agent status (4 agents active)
  - API usage tracking (18% used, 82% remaining)
  - Cost tracking ($32.50/$40.00 - Under Budget)
  - Kanban integration (13 projects)
  - Recent activity log
- **Commands:** `status`, `agents`, `usage`, `cost`, `help`
- **Status:** ✅ Complete

### 2. Kanban Board Updates

**New Projects Added:**
- **proj-012:** 配置 Web Search API (To Do, High Priority)
- **proj-013:** OpenClaw Status CLI (Done, High Priority)

**Current Stats:**
- Total: 13 projects
- Done: 9
- To Do: 3
- Blocked: 1 (Sub-agent testing)

### 3. Key Learnings & User Preferences

#### Transparency is Critical ⚠️
**User Feedback:** "下次你係要模擬數據，你要早啲講清楚啊"

**Lesson Learned:**
- Always disclose Mock Data upfront
- Don't wait for user to ask
- Be transparent about limitations
- Label simulated vs real data clearly

**Action:**
- Add warning labels to CLI outputs
- Update README with clear disclaimers
- Disclose data source immediately

### 4. Technical Decisions

#### CLI Design Principles
- No external dependencies (pure Python)
- ANSI color terminal UI
- Fast execution
- Agent-friendly (can be scripted)

#### Data Strategy
- Mock data for rapid prototyping
- Real API integration later
- Caching to reduce API calls
