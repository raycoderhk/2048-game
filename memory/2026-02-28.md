## 🛠️ Morning Newspaper Fixed

**Problem:** Rate limiting error ("Request rate increased too quickly")  
**Root Cause:** Cron job tried to use web_search (missing Brave API key)

**Solution:**
- Changed from web_search to web_fetch with specific URLs
- Added rate limiting instructions (2-second delays)
- Provided specific news URLs:
  - https://www.rthk.hk/news
  - https://www.hk01.com
  - https://news.mingpao.com
  - https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/trad

**Status:** ✅ Fixed and tested  
**Next Run:** Tomorrow 8:00 AM HKT

**File:** `/home/node/.openclaw/cron/jobs.json`

## 🔐 Kanban OAuth Implemented

**Status:** ✅ Code pushed to GitHub  
**Repo:** https://github.com/raycoderhk/kanban-board  
**Commit:** `c68dda1`

**What Was Done:**
- Created Google OAuth login UI (index.html)
- Added OAuth backend routes (server.js)
- Updated dependencies (express-session, passport, passport-google-oauth20)
- Created setup guide (GOOGLE_OAUTH_SETUP.md)
- Posted update to Discord #coding-projects

**Pending:** User needs to configure Google OAuth credentials in Zeabur

**Environment Variables Needed:**
```bash
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
GOOGLE_CALLBACK_URL=/auth/google/callback
SESSION_SECRET=your-random-secret
```

## 🏗️ OpenClaw Architecture Clarified

**Key Learning:** Role clarification between AI Assistant and Jarvis

**Roles:**
- **User (Raymond):** Decisions, review, credentials config, delegation
- **Jarvis (Chief of Staff):** Git operations, code writing, system monitoring, agent coordination, Discord/Telegram messaging, technical implementation
- **AI Assistant (Control UI):** Guidance, code snippets, explanations, should delegate execution to Jarvis

**Important Lesson:**
> AI Assistant should NOT say "you do it" for Git operations  
> AI Assistant SHOULD say "Let me relay this to Jarvis"  
> Jarvis HAS: Git permissions, file system access, command execution, full orchestration

**Incident:** Kanban OAuth - AI Assistant initially said user needs to push manually, user corrected "relay to Jarvis, that's his job!"

## 📊 Discord Integration Status

**Successfully Posted To:**
- `#technical-blog` (1476814450680922316) - Full technical blog post
- `#coding-projects` (1476504635161444432) - Multiple updates
- `#general-chat` (1476504527808233523) - Summaries

**Message IDs:**
- Technical Blog: `1477151676581286049`
- Architecture Update: `1477153231825277001`
- Kanban OAuth: `1477169114215743608`
- 2048 Game: `1477211623541440573`

**Lesson:** Discord bot can send messages, but execution (Git, files, commands) must be done by Jarvis through OpenClaw Gateway

## 💡 Key Learnings

1. **Local Build Verification is Essential**
   - Never assume "Git Push success = Deployment success"
   - Always run `npm run build` before push

2. **Jarvis Role Clarification**
   - Jarvis CAN and SHOULD handle Git operations
   - AI Assistant should delegate execution to Jarvis
   - User should treat Jarvis as chief of staff

3. **web_fetch as Alternative to web_search**
   - Can produce morning newspaper without Brave API
   - Just need to add rate limiting (2-second delays)
   - Use specific news URLs instead of search

4. **Discord Integration Works**
   - Can post to multiple channels
   - Need correct channel IDs
   - #technical-blog is the right channel for tech posts
